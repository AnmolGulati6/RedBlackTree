# RedBlackTree Implementation

Basic implementation for RedBlackTree structure 

UW Madison CS400 project

The Red-Black Tree is a tree structure that automatically maintains balance through rotations triggered by violations of red-black child relationships and the preservation of consistent black node heights

For insertion, removal, and search operations, the Red-Black Tree exhibits an average time complexity of O(log N), where N represents the total number of nodes within the tree
